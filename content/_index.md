I am a newly minted Ph.D. graduate of [William Stein](http://wstein.org). I
like [sage-ing](http://www.sagemath.org/), math-ing, and climbing. My thesis
was in computational number theory. In particular, I was interested in
algorithms for computing rational torsion points and isogeny classes of modular
abelian varieties.

Currently on the job market.
